Setup WinRM ListenerÔÉÅ
There are three ways to set up a WinRM listener:

Using winrm quickconfig for HTTP or winrm quickconfig -transport:https for HTTPS. This is the easiest option to use when running outside of a domain environment and a simple listener is required. Unlike the other options, this process also has the added benefit of opening up the Firewall for the ports required and starts the WinRM service.

Using Group Policy Objects. This is the best way to create a listener when the host is a member of a domain because the configuration is done automatically without any user input. For more information on group policy objects, see the Group Policy Objects documentation.

Using PowerShell to create the listener with a specific configuration. This can be done by running the following PowerShell commands:

$selector_set = @{
    Address = "*"
    Transport = "HTTPS"
}
$value_set = @{
    CertificateThumbprint = "E6CDAA82EEAF2ECE8546E05DB7F3E01AA47D76CE"
}

New-WSManInstance -ResourceURI "winrm/config/Listener" -SelectorSet $selector_set -ValueSet $value_set
To see the other options with this PowerShell cmdlet, see New-WSManInstance.
